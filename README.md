This is an example library with rollup and some tap test

To work with yarn 2+ rename .yarnrc.yml.example to .yarnrc.yml and change your github token to publish new versions

`yarn build` build rollup
`yarn npm publish` publish new version of package
`yarn lint` to run linter and detect problems
`yarn lint:fix` to fix linting problems
`yarn test` run test

### VS Code integration
To have a better integration with VS Code run `yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode`. This create folder and file to have a better integration between VS Code and yarn.
